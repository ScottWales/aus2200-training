    "[RMED](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/rmed) is the Unified Model Regional Model Evaluation and Development project, and it is the basis for most regional workflows. RMED provides a number of workflows:\n",

    "* [Regional Nesting Suite](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/rmed/wiki/suites/nesting)\n",
    "* [Ensemble Nesting Suite](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/rmed/wiki/suites/ensemble)\n",

    "Aus2200 makes use of the Regional Ancillary Suite for creating ancillary data (e.g. orography, vegetation) and the Regional Nesting Suite for running the model itself\n",
    "\n",
    "These suites are all relocatable to arbitrary domains. The general workflow of the RMED suites is ancillaries are created in the RAS, then one of RNS, ENS or RCS is used to run the model. The model can then be compared against observations using the RES."
